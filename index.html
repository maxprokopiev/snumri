        <p>
          Hey there, my name is Dinara.
          I am seeing the world in a way which I want to share.
          I share it through photos in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/deenarys/">instagram</a>
          through <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dinararasuleva/">drawings</a>
          and through <a href="http://www.stihi.ru/avtor/snumrik">poetry</a>
          and <a href="http://snumri.livejournal.com/">texts</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I live in Berlin, but was happily raised in Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia.
